Something interesting and self-introduction

Hi, human and aliens from the outside world!

I am an a girl majoring in International Business and Business English. But, when in the freshman year, I got in touch with big data and started thinking about how to apply data science into business analysis and strategic decision. Then I wrote a paper related to this topic with my friends and submitted it to a Nation-wide competition for innovative university students. We thought it was a great, genius idea and would absolutely shock our judges.

However, we got very little agreement and applause for this. 

We don't know what was going on. Because there are a lot of international leaders and data science professors have claimed that it will be an era for data. Business and data are definitly closly connected.

So I am here. I believe in this and I come to UW for learning data visualization and database management. In my master degree, I am going to figure out more possibilities for the combination of business analysis and data management.

Good luck to everyone!
